This is a small voice application, hosted on RHCloud. The voice browsing
capabilities are provided by the Voxeo platform(Thanks guys! :)).

The app is live and can be reached at:
    USA: +1-646-484-9994
    VOIP: 9996149558
    INUM: +883510001841969

When you dial in to the app, it'll ask you what's your department - We're
from NSEC - say out your department name(acronym) and be surprised!! :)


*Note: This app is a simple WSGI Django app with the main "thing" in the
VoiceXML part - located under /wsgi/openshift/templates/home/
